# API Contracts

**Feature**: 007-nn-training-tutorial

## N/A - No API Contracts

This feature is a client-side only tutorial with no backend services or external APIs.

All state is managed client-side using:
- TypeScript interfaces (defined in `data-model.md`)
- IntersectionObserver callbacks (browser API)
- D3.js transitions (existing dependency)

No API contracts are required.
